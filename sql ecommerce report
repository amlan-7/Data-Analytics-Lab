              Query #5 & #9 reveal high-value customers based on transaction count and total revenue.
              Query #11 identifies inactive customers.

   2. Sales Optimization by Time & Day
  
  --- Insight:
              Query #6 & #7 show peak hours and best-selling days.
  
  *** Recommendation:
                     Schedule promotions or flash sales during peak purchase hours to maximize sales.
                     Run email campaigns and ads on days with lower transactions to balance sales distribution.
   3. Personalized Discounts & Promotions
  
  --- Insight:
              Query #14 shows which product categories receive the most discounts.
              Query #2 identifies the percentage of transactions with discounts.
  
  *** Recommendation:
                     If discounts are too high in some categories but not increasing revenue, consider adjusting pricing or bundling strategies.
                     Personalized discounts based on past purchase history can drive better conversions than flat discounts.

  --- Insight:
              Query #12 determines which payment methods generate the most revenue.
  
  *** Recommendation:
                     If a particular payment method dominates, understand why others are underused (e.g., friction in checkout, security concerns).
                     Introduce additional options like Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) or digital wallets to improve conversions.
